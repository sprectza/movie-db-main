# movie-db

A RESTful API using Node.js and MongoDB that provides movie-related information and allows users to search, filter, and interact with the data.

## Functionalities

a) Fetch movie details: Users should be able to retrieve details about a movie by ID, title, or other relevant attributes.

b) Search and filtering: Users should be able to search for movies using a query parameter and filter the results based on attributes like genre, year, and rating.

c) User authentication: Users should be able to register and log in using email and password. Implement JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and secure access to user-specific features.

d) User movie interactions: Allow users to add movies to a list of favorites, rate movies, and write reviews.

e) Pagination: Implement pagination for search results and listings to limit the number of records returned per request.
